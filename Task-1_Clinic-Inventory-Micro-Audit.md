Task 1: Daily Clinic Inventory Micro-Audit

Role: Business Analyst (Clinic Operations)

What problem I am trying to solve

In a small clinic pharmacy, inventory errors happen daily because:

medicine names are typed manually

the same medicine is entered in different ways

quantities are sometimes entered incorrectly

these small mistakes are ignored and become big problems at month end

The doctor does not have time to check inventory daily.
So the goal is to catch small mistakes early using a simple daily routine that clinic staff can actually follow.

Step 1: Identify High-Risk Medicines (One-time activity)

Checking all medicines every day is not practical.
So I first identify medicines where mistakes are most likely.

Criteria I used

medicines with high daily sales

medicines with confusing or similar names

medicines prescribed frequently by the doctor

High-Risk Medicines List
Medicine Name	Why I marked it high risk
Dolo 650	Very high usage and multiple name variations
Azithromycin 500	Staff often uses short names
Pantoprazole 40	Prescribed daily, high movement

This list will be reviewed once a month and updated if required.

Step 2: Daily Name Variation Check (≈10 minutes per day)
Why this is needed

Many inventory mismatches happen because the same medicine is entered using different names.

What I do every day

Open the sales register for the day

Filter only the high-risk medicines

Look for different spellings or name variations

Map all variations to one standard (master) name

Example Mapping Table
Entered Names	Final Master Name
Dolo, Dolo kind, Dolo 650	Dolo 650
Azithro, Azithromycin	Azithromycin 500
Action taken

New or wrong names are noted

Staff is informed immediately

No penalties, only correction

This slowly improves billing discipline.

Step 3: Daily Stock Reasonableness Check (≈10 minutes)
Purpose

To check whether the daily sales quantity makes sense.

How I check

For each high-risk medicine:

Expected Closing Stock = Opening Stock + Purchases − Total Sales

Then I compare it with actual closing stock.

Sample Daily Check
Medicine	Expected	Actual	Difference	Action
Dolo 650	1460	1440	−20	Check sales entries
Decision rule

Small difference (within ~2%) → ignore

Bigger difference → review sales entries

This avoids unnecessary panic while still catching real errors.

Step 4: Random Bill Spot Check (5–10 minutes)
Why this helps

Random checks make staff more careful even without strict supervision.

What I do

Randomly pick 3–5 bills involving high-risk medicines

Check:

correct medicine name

quantity looks reasonable

Log any mistake found

There is no punishment, only correction and learning.

Step 5: Error Log & Weekly Review (15 minutes weekly)
Error Log (maintained daily)
Date	Medicine	Error	Repeated?
Aug 1	Dolo 650	Name variation	Yes
Aug 3	Dolo 650	Quantity error	No
Weekly review logic

Same mistake repeating → staff explanation or retraining

Errors across many medicines → update SOP

Serious financial impact → escalate

Step 6: Doctor Escalation Rules

The doctor is involved only when really needed.

Doctor is informed if:

financial impact is significant

same issue keeps repeating

medicine shortage affects patient care

All routine checks are handled without disturbing the doctor.

Final Result of This System

Small mistakes are caught daily

Staff becomes more disciplined naturally

Month-end inventory shocks reduce

Doctor time is fully protected

This routine can be completed in 20–30 minutes per day and can start immediately
